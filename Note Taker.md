  ## Description

  https://shrouded-harbor-38847.herokuapp.com/
  
  This project was made using JavaScript and Express to experiment with routes. The purpose of the application is to store notes the user inputs, into a database and from there it is posting it onto the HTML as a saved note. This project was intentially used for me to learn routes and use databases to store information as objects. The user experience of this project, will give the user an option to add a title for their note and their note, and from there all saved notes will be viewable on the left hand side or the user to select between.
